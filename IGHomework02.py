"""
Phase 1
In the first phase your program will ask a user to enter three credit card numbers to be
validated. You will need to store these three credit card numbers in a list. Each number should
be different so donâ€™t input the same three credit card numbers in a row. You will need to use a
loop which will keep looping in this phase until three credit card numbers have been entered.

"""
Phase 2
Then in phase two you will need to use a for loop and go through the list of credit card numbers
you collected from Phase 1 and check if each number is valid.
To check if a credit card number is valid you need to use the following rules:
1. The number will be 16 digits long.
2. The number must all be digits with no characters.
3. The number will start with a 4,5 or 6.
(Hint: Look in Appendix A in your book for functions that will help you to check these rules.
Also, you can look at this website for example code of how to loop through each character of a
string:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-characters-of-a-string-in-python/)
If a credit card number is not valid it should be removed from the list. A message should be
printed to the screen that states that a number was not valid and was removed.
When this phase is complete you should have a list of valid credit cards to send to Phase 3

    #print(Numbers)

        for i in Numbers:

            #     print('16 is cause')
            # if (not i.isdigit()):
            #     print('isdigit is cause')
            #if ((int(i[0]) in [4,5,6])):
                #print((int(i[0]) not in [4,5,6]))

            if ((len(i) == 16) and ((i.isdigit()) and (int(i[0]) in [4,5,6]))):
                continue
            else:
                print(f"{i} is an invalid credit number and has been removed")

    for y in toRemove:
        Numbers.remove(str(y))

    return Phase3(Numbers, True)
"""
Phase 3
In this last phase you will go through the list of credit cards you checked in Phase 2 and print
each of them out in groups of four numbers using dashes.
For an example:
If the credit card input is 4234567890909999 then you should print it to the screen like this
4234-5678-9090-9999. (Notice the dashes)

    else:
        print("No card numbers left!")
        return Numbers, False	
    
"""
Additional Requirements
Make sure that you use try except in your code to help catch errors.
Each phase of your program should occur inside its own function. You should name these
functions phase1(), phase2() and phase3(). You will need to figure out how to pass the list of
credit cards from one phase to another.
Your solution should be just one py file. Turn in that py file for grading when finished.
